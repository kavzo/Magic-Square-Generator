Psybergate’s Graduate Programme assessment.

The program asks the user to enter a value (from 0 to 3) for rotation where: 
if rotation = 0, then the starting 1 is top middle;
If rotation = 1, then the starting 1 is right middle;
If rotation = 2, then the starting 1 is bottom middle;
If rotation = 3, then the starting 1 is left middle.
Else an “Invalid message” error will be shown.

Once a rotation value has been inputted, the user is then asked to input a dimension. For example, ‘3’ will produce a 3x3 magic square.
Once the user enters the value, a magic square with the previously inputted values is shown, with the constant sum of the magic square.
